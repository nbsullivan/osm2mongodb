# osm2mongodb
parsing, cleaning, auditing and transforming osm files to mongodb

Initial region of analysis: Portland Oregon
Data location: https://s3.amazonaws.com/metro-extracts.mapzen.com/portland_oregon.osm.bz2

I have visted portland a few times before, I have some family out there so I thought it would be an interesting place to look at some mapping data there.

To Dos:
    -get the scripts working in a class struture
    -set up interface for the OSM API
    -implement ML clustering algos for neighborhood classification
    -implement cleaning of more fields (see discussion about resturant cuisine type)
